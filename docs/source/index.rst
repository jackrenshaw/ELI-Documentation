Welcome to ELI's documentation!
===================================

**ELI** (Electronics Laboratory Interface) is a Project Developed by Jack Renshaw (UNSW) for his undergraduate thesis. The project aims to give electronics students a remote laboratory interface that closes the gap between remote and in-person laboratories. The purpose of this documentation is to provide laboratory demonstrators and course coordinators support in their implementation and adaptation of this platform. The project requires knowledge of Microsoft Power Automate, Excel Proficiency and LabVIEW.
